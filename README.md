# Analysis of US obesity using visual analytics techniques

This is the coursework for my Visual Analytics module at City, University of London in 2018-19. It was an individual project where I chose a dataset and performed visual analytics. Then, I wrote a paper explaining my findings. 

This project was to investigate geographic variations in obesity and to see if other health, socio-economic, environmental or demograpic factors could explain the variation. I used a county shape file to create chorpleths and analyse the data geograpically. I created scatterplots and histograms to check for outliers and to review data after transforming it. I created a heatmap of a correlation matrix or features. I created linear regression models for each highly correlated feature and produced scatter plots to visualise the actual and predicted values. I built choropleths of the model residuals (difference between actuals and predictions) to view geograhical differences for each feature. 

There are four files:
  1) 2018CountyHealthRankingsData-v1.xls - County Health Rankings data from: http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/explore-health-rankings/rankings-data-documentation
  2) LDwyer INM433 Coursework Notebook.ipynb - the Jupyter Notebook I built including Python code, explanations and some visualisations
  3) Health by County.twb - Tableau workbook I used to build some of the visualisations
  4) LDwyer INM433 Coursework.pdf - the paper I wrote explaining my findings.
  
To run the Python code, save files 1-2 into the same directory. Open Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the directory where you've saved the files. Run the notebook.
